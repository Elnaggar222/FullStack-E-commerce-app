Unauthenticated users can now add items to a local cart, which is persistently stored in localStorage using Redux Toolkit Persistor. Additionally, user information is also stored in localStorage upon login.

When a user logs in:

All items from the local cart are automatically added to their account cart in the database.
If an item already exists in the userâ€™s cart, its quantity is updated accordingly.
If the item is new, it is added as a separate entry.
After merging, the local cart is cleared, ensuring a seamless transition between guest and authenticated shopping.
